## Binary Tree (BT)
[See the code](src/main/java/trees/.java)

[See the tests]()

A binary tree is a data structure where each node can have up to 2 children nodes.  There is no specific sorting order, like in a Binary Search Tree,

## Approach & Efficiency
_enqueue_: This process adds a node to the back of the queue.  Tail then is assigned this new node. If the queue is empty, the front is assigned this new node.  Time and space complexity are both the same at O(1);

_dequeue_: This process removes a node from the front of the queue and returns the value.  Front is then assigned the node behind it.  Time and space complexity are both the same at O(1).

_peek_: This process returns the value of the front node and does not remove anything.  Therefore, time and space complexity are both the same at O(1);
