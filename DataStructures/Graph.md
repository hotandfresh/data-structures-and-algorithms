# Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure of nodes connected by edges.

## Challenge
Implement a graph.

[See the Code](src/main/java/graph/Graph.java)

[See the Tests](src/test/java/graph/GraphTest.java)

## Approach & Efficiency


## Methods
```addNode```: add a new node to the graph. takes in the value of that node and returns the added node.

```addEdge```: adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph. includes the ability to have a weight.  takes in two nodes to be connected by the edge; both nodes are already in the graph.

```getNodes```: returns all the nodes in the graph as a collection.

```getNeighbors```: takes in a node and returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node. includes the weight of the connection in the returned collection.

```size```: returns the total number of nodes in the graph.
