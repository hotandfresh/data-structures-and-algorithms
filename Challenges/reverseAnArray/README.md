# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Given an array, reverse its contents. Do not use any built in reverse methods.

## Problem Solving Process

This solution implements a 2 pointer strategy.  One starts at the beginning of the array, and the other starts at the end of the array.  As long as the start pointer is not greater than the end pointer, swap the elements.
